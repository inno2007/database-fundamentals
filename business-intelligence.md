# Business Intelligence, Big Data & Analytics

This section introduces how modern businesses use data to drive decisions through **Business Intelligence (BI)** and **Big Data**. It also covers data quality, ethics, and analytic methods.

---

## 1. What is Business Intelligence?

**Business Intelligence (BI)** refers to technologies and processes that gather, store, and analyze data to help organizations make informed decisions.

Includes:
- Dashboards
- Reporting systems
- Data mining tools
- Predictive modeling

---

## 2. What is Big Data?

**Big Data** refers to massive volumes of structured and unstructured data generated at high speed and variety.

### Big Data Characteristics (The 5 V's):

| Characteristic | Description                                           |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Volume         | Large amounts of data                                 |
| Velocity       | Speed at which data is generated/processed            |
| Variety        | Different formats: text, video, images, logs          |
| Veracity       | Uncertainty in the quality or accuracy of data        |
| Value          | Useful insights that can be extracted from data       |

## 3. Types of Data Analytics

| Type              | Description                                                   |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Descriptive       | Analyzes past data to understand what happened                |
| Diagnostic        | Identifies reasons behind past outcomes                       |
| Predictive        | Uses models to forecast future events                         |
| Prescriptive      | Suggests actions based on predictions                         |

## 4. OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)

**OLAP** is used for complex analytical queries on large volumes of data.

- Data is stored in **multidimensional cubes**
- Enables slicing, dicing, drill-down, and roll-up operations
- Used for BI dashboards and reports

---

## 5. Data Ethics & Quality

### Ethical Considerations

- Data privacy and consent
- Fair and transparent algorithms
- Avoiding bias in decision-making
- Responsibility in data usage (e.g. surveillance, profiling)

### Data Quality Dimensions

| Dimension     | Description                                 |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Accuracy      | Data correctly represents real-world facts  |
| Completeness  | No missing values or gaps                   |
| Timeliness    | Data is up-to-date                          |
| Consistency   | Uniform across multiple systems             |
| Validity      | Matches expected formats or rules           |

## 6. Decision Support Systems (DSS)

A **DSS** is a software system that uses data and models to help users make business decisions.

May use:
- Real-time dashboards
- Forecasting tools
- Risk modeling

---

## Summary

- BI helps transform raw data into meaningful insights.
- Big Data is characterized by volume, variety, and velocity.
- Descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics are key for decision-making.
- Ethical handling of data is essential for fair and responsible use.
